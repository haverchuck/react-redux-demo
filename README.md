# react-redux-demo
This repo was created with create-react-app.

Redux has been added for state management.  

The purpose of this app is to serve as a POC for an application to allow enterprise users to create complex organization relationships using a tree-like user interface.  

It is a work in progress and will not be functional at all times.

It will work with my other repo, an react-redux-project-server.  The server is currently a standard REST api connected to postgres.  However, eventually I plan to remove postgres from the API and instead use graphql.  The api will eventually only serve business logic.
